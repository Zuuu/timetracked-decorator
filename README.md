# timetracked-decorator

This decorator allows to track execution time for methods and functions.

It outputs the name of decorated function and the class name in case if the function is a method.

```
$ ./timetracked.py

A simple decorator function could not be used â€” it is not possible to get the class name if the function to be decorated is a method (in some cases the class name can be obtained from arguments, but not always). Therefore, the class-decorator `_Timetracked` was implemented, with which it is possible to get information about the object calling the method through the `__get__` descriptor.

Compatible with Python 2/3.
